Intangibility has certain traits to ah understand.
An intangible asset we need to look at the trades of intangibility.
What makes an asset and intangible asset ? Economists have given certain traits, but when we come
to the legal aspects of it, these traits will be important for us to understand, so that
we can give ah the character of intangibility to intellectual property assets because intellectual
property assets are ah the products that can be covered by an intellectual property, right
exit with these traits . Intangibles when we talk about intangibles,
we are talking about ideas, commercial relationships and know-how ideas can be protected.
The expression of ideas can be protected by the copyright regime know-how . When it is
translated onto a product which involves a technology, that can be protected by ah patents.
Commercial relationships are largely protected by the law with regard to confidential information
or what we also call trade secrets.
That is largely the contractual regime.
You can have a contract with a person with to whom you are disclosing relationships.
Commercial relationships are commercially sensitive, information and bind that person
through a non-disclosure agreement in such a way that a trade secret is protected.
Now, let us look at the 4 traits of intangibility.
The first trait as ah economists tells us is scalability.
The intangible asset is scalable . The 2nd trait is sunkenness.
The intangible asset is created by cause that is sunk in the sense that you will be hard
to recover those costs.
The 3rd trait is spillover.
Spillover in the sense that when an intangible asset is created apart from the person who
created the asset, others get benefit too and 4rth trait of intangibility is that it
can cause synergies having one intangible asset and another asset together can cause
synergy which would normally not be the case if the assets are used separately.
Now, let us look at these 4 traits in detail.
Though this is an account by economists, we will find that this holds good.
This analysis of the 4 traits of intangibility holds good for illegal analysis as well .
So, first we look at the scalability aspect . We say something is scalable when there
is no limit on the capacity to make those things.
For instance, intangible assets have a trait of mass duplication.
You can make multiple copies of an intangible asset.
For instance, if it is a book, the intangible asset being the creative work of the author,
then that book you can make multiple copies of it without there being any decrease in
the ah output of the book itself in the sense that any person who get reached the book,
gets an understanding of the book, the ideas covered in the book without diminishing the
asset.
Now, economists call this as non-rival goods or earlier it also used to be called as knowledge
goods.
Now, knowledge goods and non-rival goods tell us that there are certain goods that are non-rival
in nature especially for this is true for intangible goods.
Rival goods are goods which can be used by only one person or a group of people.
When a group of people, consumer group, it is simply not made available for others.
For instance, a piece of can be shared by a finite number of people.
There are limitations to what you can do with a piece of a cake.
A book on the other hand can also be read by only one, by one person, but the idea that
conveyed in the book if the book is relayed say on You tube, assume that the book is shown
the pages are flipped on the youtube, every person who can have access to You tube can
read the book as the book is being flipped and get the complete understanding of the
book, as a person would get while reading the hard copy of the book.
So, when the book, when a video is made out of the book in the sense that ah the reading
of the book, a book is held in front of a camera and it is short and it is relayed to
100s and 1000s of people , every person who reads the book gets the same enjoyment or
benefit out of the book, out of the idea that is communicated in the book as it would be
in the case of a person who physically reads one copy of the book.
Now, this talks about the scalability.
Intangible assets can be scaled to any number.
Now, if you regard microsofts software windows as an intangible asset, then you can see that
any number of copies of a windows program can be made without affecting the enjoyment
of others.
So, this ah tells us that there are certain goods that are non-rival.
In ah nature, rival goods are goods only few or finite number of people can consume.
Non-rival or non-rival less goods are goods without physical limitations.
There is no limit to the number of people who can consume that book.
So, ah sharing a book and we are talking about not physically sharing even the physical sharing
if you look at a book, if assume that a group of students sit next to each other and share
and read from a common book . Now, ah all the students who look into the
book and read from the book can actually derive the enjoyment from the book as it would be
the case.
If they read the book separately and this enjoyment each one of them gets does not affect
the enjoyment of the other in the sense that they get a complete understanding of the concepts
mentioned in the book without affecting the enjoyment or the benefit that others get while
reading the book, whereas in the cake example you simply cannot enjoy a cake without affecting
others who are sharing that with you.
Now, ah this example can be magnified or we can take this example to a different level..
when we compare the number of people whom we can accommodate in a room.
Now, normally in a classroom you could have a teacher and a few students depending on
the size of the classroom . Now, if you want to increase the number of people in that room,
what you could do is, you could remove all the furnitures and then, you could put people
there.
Then, though it may look crowded, you can have say host a tea party or a lunch and you
can have more people standing there and utilizing the room.
Now, if you want to use the room or rent the room for purposes of accommodating people,
then you can put some beds and bunker beds if necessary and you can slightly increase
the number of people who can actually use the room for say as an accommodation.
Now, you can extend this idea, but at the end there will be a limit to the number of
people who can actually enjoy the room.
So, that is a rival good.
A room which has constraints of space and which has physical limitations like a physical
asset, a room has certain limitations as to how many people can actually use it.
So, if you stuff the room with more people, then it can actually handle.
Then, there could be some consequences which will go beyond what a person can handle . So,
a room is a typical example of a rival product.
Now, let us look at a room in the online space.
For instance, a chat room.
A room which people can use for chatting, there is absolutely no limitation as to how
many people can chat in a chat room.
Absolutely no limitation because what we have done here is that in a chat room because it
is created by an intangible asset software and because it exists in the internet or somewhere
in the cloud, you can ensure that the number of people who are in the room can be boundless,
it can be limitless.
So, physical assets have limitations whereas, there cannot be any limitation on intellectual
assets . So, another example that we can understand
are NPTEL classes themselves much different from a normal class.
In NPTEL class, we would allow any number of ah students who have access to the internet
and to youtube to have access to these classes.
So, what in effect happens in NPTEL class is that the intangible nature of the delivery
which is by using software, the voice and the video of a professor who has recorded
the lecture is now delivered to limitless number of people.
There is absolutely no limit to the number of people who can enjoy or who can use NPTEL
class.
So, this talks about the scalability aspect of intangible assets.
Intangible assets by definition are scalable.
For instance, somebody writes a book and the book can be protected by copyright.
Now, the number of copies you can make of the book is infinite, especially if you convert
the book into some kind of an e-form and say an e-format or an e-copy or a kindle copy
of a book.
So, there is absolutely no limit to how you can scale an intangible effect asset.
Now, intangible effect the scalability is also affected by what we call the networks
effect . The networks effect is simply that if more people have telephone connections,
the network effect makes it easy to scale up and it brings more benefit to people.
Now, we see that in whatsapp the more people who have whatsapp, the more it becomes easier
to communicate with those people.
So, scalability is enhanced by ah the networks effect.
Now, 2 Sunkness; sunkeness refers to the cost of creation that went into the creation of
the intangible asset what we call the investment that went into creation of the intangible
asset.
Now, sunkenness is there almost in every asset; both intangible that is physical as well as
intangible assets, but the probability or the possibility of recovering the cost is
much difficult when it comes to an intangible asset.
Now, this is also referred to as the cost of creating the first copy.
For instance, microsoft windows would have expended enormous amount of resources in coming
up with the first copy of windows or few years back, we had something called the Vista.
Now, vista is now a discontinued product.
What happens to the cost that has gone into the creation of vista?
Vista being an intangible asset, now the cost that went into creating the software is ah
simply cannot be recovered now.
So, in that sense it is much harder to recover the cost that goes into ah intangible asset
than it is in the case of a tangible asset.
For instance, land, building and factory which belong to a company can at any time be sold
if the business does not move forward whereas, intangible assets like lists of customers
for instance or operation procedures in a showroom, there is a company which runs a
showroom and they have an operation procedure which only suits that showroom.
So, if they had spent enormous amount of time in creating that intangible effect, thus the
manual of operations, it will be very hard for them to use that manual in another surrounding
or in another situation.
Now, again ah the sunkenness cost can be understood in what we saw in Gilead Sovaldi.
Sovaldi as we saw was a drug which Gilead acquired when it took over the company Kite
Pharma and Kite Pharma that was valued at 11 billion dollars at the time of its purchase
, but we know that Kite Pharma was absorbed into Gileads company and the drug later on
became a blockbuster drug getting revenues in excess of 20 million in the year 2017.
Now, all the money that went into creating Kite Pharma and the drug, the potential drug
which was later on acquired by Gilead and which later on got approved as Sovaldi, it
will not be possible to recover those costs, the R and D teams and all the equipments that
went into creation of the drug.
The creation of the drug may get monetized when the drug becomes a best seller.
For instance, let us look at another drug which say hypothetically developed by the
same company for which there was no recovery of cost, a drug that eventually led to a failure
for probably the drug did not reach the market.
Now, this tells us that when we are dealing with intangibles, intangible assets have an
cost that is sunk into it which may be harder to recover than in the case of a physical
asset.
Physical asset as we all know like land, building and factory even if there is no need to continue
with the particular business, you should be able to sell the land, building and equipment
in a factory and get some ah cost recovered by say ah lump sum sale or a piecemeal sale.
So, unlike a physical asset, intellectual property assets or intangible assets become
hard for people to recover the cost that has gone into it.
Now, a good example is Kingfisher Airlines.
Kingfisher Airlines we know that had pledged its brand furniture and various other things
for 1.2 billion dollars for the loans that the company had taken.
Now, a substantial part of this ah pledge relied on the brand of Kingfisher and brand
as we know is an intangible asset and we know what happened later on.
Kingfisher was not able to pay the debts and it led to the ah closure of the company and
also due to weight and it also led to other complications for the promoter.
Now, here is a case where the sunken cost into building, the brand whatever Kingfisher
did to build the brand is something which cannot be recovered which the banks realized
when they pledged a loan predominantly based on the brand . When loans are given based
on a brand which is an intangible asset, then it could lead to a situation like what we
saw in the case of Kingfisher Airlines.
This largely is due to the fact that the cost that goes into an intangible asset into the
creation of an intangible asset is a sunk cost and it becomes hard to recover that cost
. 3 is Spill overs.
Now, spillover refers to the fact that ah the benefit of an intangible asset may accrue
on others.
The economists also called this as non-excludable nature of an intangible asset.
An asset of intangible nature when it is released or when it is used, it could lead to others
getting benefited by it.
For instance, ah when iphone released the first phone in 2007, it created the smartphone
category.
The smartphone category was created by iphone.
Now, when apple created this category, they were the market leaders.
They were the ones who brought out a phone with a full touchscreen without any ah dial
pad.
Iphone though was the pioneer in this field had to live with the fact that others would
be creating smartphones as well.
So, though iphone created the category, Samsung, LG, Motorola and others got the benefit of
the spillover.
So, in creating an intangible asset, there is a spill over which you may not be able
to stop others from enjoying it.
So, the owner in effect may not reap all the rewards of the product.
So, one of the solutions that have been suggested to get over the problem of spill overs is
to have government funding.
So, all the basic work or research that is being done, if it is funded, but by the government,
the follow on work alone needs to be done by the market and that would lead to a situation
where the market develops something which has already been funded by the government.
Now, for instance the United States government funds 30 percent of R and D that happens in
that country.
Now, the spillover is also ah something which could be potentially protected by intellectual
property, right.
Now, the term of IP refers to the timeline during which IP cannot be used by others.
An intellectual property cannot be used by others during the term of IP.
For instance, if there is a trademark protection over a brand, then the brand cannot be used
by others.
If there is a copyright protection over ah artistic work, the copyrighted work cannot
be used by others.
So, we have this instance of how ah the term of IP can be extended to protect the spillover
effect.
Disney the creators of Mickey Mouse had a life term for the copyright which would have
expired in 1984 , but disney was able to successfully lobby and extend the life till 2023.
Now, this ah happened by bringing in two amendments to the copyright term which disney had lobbied
for in 1976 and 1998.
So, one way to get over the spillover effect is to have strong intellectual property rights
and one way to extend the intellectual property life itself is to have a longer term on IP
. 4 is Synergies.
The value of intangible increase when they are combined with other intangibles, for instance
Apple is a company which has combined software, hardware and a supply chain to come up with
elegant and user friendly products which can reach any part of the world with a very short
time.
You would know that all the iphone releases, they were close to global launches and the
copies were available or the models were available as soon as they were globally launched to
other parts of the world as well.
Coca Cola is another company which combines the synergies of a brand which is an intangible
formula.
There is the secret formula which Coke is supposed to have developed and it protects
it and a distribution network.
So, these things make ah a synergy or create a synergy which gives Coca Cola a lead over
other competitors.
Now, innovation itself has been defined as something that happens when ideas come together.
So, you know synergy is something which promotes the creation of an intangible asset and many
a times the synergy itself gives an advantage to the producer . The producer because of
the synergy, he has in the company or in the enterprise that is run by ah the producer
because the producer has certain synergies.
It is possible for the producer to come up with new intangible assets by way of ah combining
existing assets.
Now, two of the business models that we know today, Uber and Air B and B are models that
existed before hiring a cab was something which people knew and renting out premises
say for the use of a paying guest was something which we already knew, but the synergy caused
by the availability of smartphone and the connectivity of smartphone actually allowed
these models to flourish.
So, you can see that Uber is a model that could only work if people have smartphone
and Uber developed apps for it Air B and B. Similarly is a model that will only work if
people are connected over the internet and they are able to show their property and engage
with others who are interested in staying in those properties.
So, ah synergy is another aspect or another trait of an intellectual . Synergy is another
trait of an intangible asset . Now, what is the outcome of these 4 things?
So, the outcome of these 4 traits of intangibility is that one, it causes uncertainty and two,
it causes contestedness uncertainty because there is intangibles by the nature.
We saw that because of the sunkenness and because of the spillover that intangibles
create it is hard to ascertain and derive the value of an intangible.
Now, Coca Cola may be able to value its brand at a very high price.
They simply may not be anybody to buy the brand because of its valuation, because of
the uncertainty that goes into the valuation of the brand.
We saw in the case of Kingfisher Airlines.
The brand and some properties were together, the pledge for 1.2 billion you know when it
turned out, the banks were not able to recover this value though they had pledged money equivalent
based on the brand predominantly . So, ah there is uncertainty that comes out
of an intangible asset and intangible assets by definition are investments that are of
an uncertain nature.
So, there is uncertainty and second thing is that we need to understand about these
4 traits contribute to contestedness.
There are disputes with regard to intellectual property rights that constantly arise because
the nature of the intellectual property right leads it to be contested.
When a patent is granted by the patent office, when the patentee enforces the patent, it
allows the patentee to stop others from doing things in that particular area and if it is
something that ought not to have been granted, a patent to say a technology which was already
there or a technology which was obvious to people in that are to come up with or a technology
which was in the public domain, but only few people knew about it.
For various reasons, an intellectual property right may get contested.
So, contestedness is another outcome of intangible assets .
